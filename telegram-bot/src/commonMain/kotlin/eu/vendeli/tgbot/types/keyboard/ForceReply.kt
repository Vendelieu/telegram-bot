/**
 * Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display a reply interface to the user (act as if the user has selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'). This can be extremely useful if you want to create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice privacy mode.
 *
 * Api reference: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#forcereply
 * @property forceReply Shows reply interface to the user, as if they manually selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'
 * @property inputFieldPlaceholder Optional. The placeholder to be shown in the input field when the reply is active; 1-64 characters
 * @property selective Optional. Use this parameter if you want to force reply from specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply to a message in the same chat and forum topic, sender of the original message.
